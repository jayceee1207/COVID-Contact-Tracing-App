## This is the front-part of my program, ViruTrack: COVID-19 Contact Tracing App. There seven buttons as you can see: 

### 1. SELECT FILE:

##### Select File button allows the user to open a file. In my program, the main file that it accept is CSV CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.  CSV files typically have a smaller file size compared to other formats like Excel (.xlsx) or databases. This compactness makes them ideal for scenarios where file size and storage efficiency are crucial considerations.

### 2. ADD INFORMATION:

##### When the Add Information button is pressed, a new window appears and a series of questions are displayed, including those for Name, Age, Address, Email, Contact Number, Date and Time, and Temperature. Additionally, we will inquire as to whether they have recently experienced COVID symptoms or if they have come into contact with anyone else who is exhibiting these symptoms. In addition, they will be required to declare their sincerity when responding to questions. 

### 3. EDIT INFORMATION:


##### When the button for editing information is pressed, users just enter the entry number where "View Information" may be seen. The Edit Information window will then appear, allowing them to edit and save their prior response. To see if the information has changed, they can view it again in the program that lets them view information.  

### 4. DELETE INFORMATION:

##### When the button for deleting information is pressed, users just enter the entry number where "View Information" may be seen. The Delete Information window will then appear, allowing them to delete their response. To see if the information has changed, they can view it again in the view information window.
