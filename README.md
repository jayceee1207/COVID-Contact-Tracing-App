##### Select File button allows the user to open a file. In my program, the main file that it accept is CSV CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.  CSV files typically have a smaller file size compared to other formats like Excel (.xlsx) or databases. This compactness makes them ideal for scenarios where file size and storage efficiency are crucial considerations.
